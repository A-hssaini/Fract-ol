# Computer graphics project

This project is meant to create graphically beautiful fractals.

$This new project will be the opportunity for you to hone your miniLibX skills, to
make you discover/use the mathematical notion of complex numbers and to take a peek
at the concept of optimization in computer graphics.
Itâ€™s time for you to light all the pixels of your screen at the same time!
